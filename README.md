I used this to understand more about the LastRow() https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/last-row-column-vba/

This was super helpful for understanding how to run macro through the sheets in workbook
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26039872/declaring-variable-workbook-worksheet-vba
and then I came across this while looking at how to have the macro go through all the sheets https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21761697/for-each-function-to-loop-through-specifically-named-worksheets?noredirect=1&lq=1
Thats when I tried Array(). And I realized this is nice cause theoretically the macro can be updated easily to add new tabs

I used http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/excel/colors.htm list from class to set the color format. Also the activity on credit card from class was really helpful. Thats what the Cells <> Cells was from. I talked to some other folks that used a Date method, which I looked up though didn't dig into it.

I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35710805/getting-percentage-value-to-show-in-the-correct-format to look at how to change format to percentage


I ran into a problem with last part. maxVolume ended up as an infinite loop and would either crash by itself or crash when I tried to stop it. Not sure what the problem is but I have a few ideas I'll work on, though I ran outta time for now.
